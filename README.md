## How to Navigate
Below are links to my featured projects, each demonstrating different skills and expertise:

- **Artifact 1: Stock Recommender Engine**

  [View Repository](https://github.com/dylanpatel78/Stock-Recommender-Engine) 

  The Stock Recommender Engine is an innovative stock analysis tool that simplifies investment decision-making. It evaluates stocks based on
  financial performance and public sentiment, empowering users to identify the best opportunities. By allowing users to select a sector (e.g.,
  Technology, Energy, Healthcare) and specify their budget, the tool ranks affordable stocks using a combination of performance metrics and
  sentiment analysis from news articles.

- **Artifact 2: Automated Medical Image Diagnosis**

  [View Repository](https://github.com/dylanpatel78/DermaNet-Diagnostic-System)

  DermaNet is a machine learning-based web application designed to assist in detecting skin conditions from dermatology images. Using a
  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system classifies skin lesions, focusing on identifying conditions such as melanoma. The application
  integrates a React frontend, Flask backend, and a deep learning model for seamless real-time predictions.

- **Artifact 3: Predicting Car Resale Value**

  [View Repository](https://github.com/dylanpatel78/Car-Resale-Value-Prediction)

  This project explores the factors influencing car resale prices in the automotive market. By analyzing attributes such as year, mileage, engine
  size, and fuel type, the team developed a predictive model using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. The notebook provides
  insights into market trends, consumer preferences, and the determinants of vehicle pricing, offering valuable tools for sellers, buyers, and
  dealerships alike.
