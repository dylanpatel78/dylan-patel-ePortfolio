## How to Navigate
Below are links to my featured projects, each demonstrating different skills and expertise:

- **Artifact 1: Stock Recommender Engine**

  [View Repository](https://github.com/dylanpatel78/Stock-Recommender-Engine) 

  The Stock Recommender Engine is an innovative stock analysis tool that simplifies investment decision-making. It evaluates stocks based on
  financial performance and public sentiment, empowering users to identify the best opportunities. By allowing users to select a sector (e.g.,
  Technology, Energy, Healthcare) and specify their budget, the tool ranks affordable stocks using a combination of performance metrics and
  sentiment analysis from news articles.

  This artifact demonstrates my ability to combine data analysis and machine learning to create tools that solve real-world problems. Working on this project improved my technical expertise
  in **natural language processing** and **sentiment analysis**, as well as my ability to create user-centric solutions.

- **Artifact 2: Automated Medical Image Diagnosis**

  [View Repository](https://github.com/dylanpatel78/DermaNet-Diagnostic-System)

  DermaNet is a machine learning-based web application designed to assist in detecting skin conditions from dermatology images. Using a
  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system classifies skin lesions, focusing on identifying conditions such as melanoma. The application
  integrates a React frontend, Flask backend, and a deep learning model for seamless real-time predictions.

  This artifact showcases my ability to implement a **full-stack solution** for a complex problem. By using TensorFlow for the model and React for the frontend, I strengthened my expertise
  in **end-to-end development** and contributed to making healthcare tools more accessible and user-friendly.

- **Artifact 3: Predicting Car Resale Value**

  [View Repository](https://github.com/dylanpatel78/Car-Resale-Value-Prediction)

  This project explores the factors influencing car resale prices in the automotive market. By analyzing attributes such as year, mileage, engine
  size, and fuel type, the team developed a predictive model using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. The notebook provides
  insights into market trends, consumer preferences, and the determinants of vehicle pricing, offering valuable tools for sellers, buyers, and
  dealerships alike.

  This artifact highlights my ability to use **data-driven approaches** to solve practical problems. Developing the predictive model improved my skills in **data preprocessing**, **feature
  engineering**, and applying machine learning algorithms such as **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest**. The insights gained from this project demonstrate my analytical skills and
  understanding of market dynamics.
