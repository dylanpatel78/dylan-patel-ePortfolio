## How to Navigate
Below are links to my featured projects, each demonstrating different skills and expertise:

- **Artifact 1: Stock Recommender Engine**

  [View Repository](https://github.com/dylanpatel78/Stock-Recommender-Engine) 

  The Stock Recommender Engine is an innovative stock analysis tool that simplifies investment decision-making. It evaluates stocks based on
  financial performance and public sentiment, empowering users to identify the best opportunities. By allowing users to select a sector (e.g.,
  Technology, Energy, Healthcare) and specify their budget, the tool ranks affordable stocks using a combination of performance metrics and
  sentiment analysis from news articles.

- **Artifact 2: Automated Medical Image Diagnosis**

  [View Repository](https://github.com/dylanpatel78/DermaNet-Diagnostic-System)

  DermaNet is a machine learning-based web application designed to assist in detecting skin conditions from dermatology images. Using a
  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system classifies skin lesions, focusing on identifying conditions such as melanoma. The application
  integrates a React frontend, Flask backend, and a deep learning model for seamless real-time predictions.
